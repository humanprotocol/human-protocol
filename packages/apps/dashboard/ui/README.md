## âœ¨ Demo

First, let's install the dependencies, `yarn` is used as a package manager:

```bash
$ yarn install
```

The application needs access to environment variables in order to work correctly, for this, create one of the `.env.<NODE_ENV>` files, depending on the state of your environment:

```bash
$ export NODE_ENV=development
```

Use the `.env.example` file as an example to create a configuration file with certain environment variables:

```bash
$ cp .env.example .env.development
```

## ðŸš€ Usage

### Running the app

```bash
$ yarn run start
```

### Testing the app

```bash
# unit tests
$ yarn run test
```

# Branching

[GitFlow convention](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/git-flow) is to be followed (and feature PRs should target `develop` branch rather than `main`)

## Deployment Endpoints
