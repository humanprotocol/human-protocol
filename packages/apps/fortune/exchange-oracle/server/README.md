## ‚ú® Demo

First, let's install the dependencies, `yarn` is used as a package manager:

```bash
$ yarn install
```

The application needs access to environment variables in order to work correctly, for this, create one of the `.env.<NODE_ENV>` files, depending on the state of your environment:

```bash
$ export NODE_ENV=development
```

Use the `.env.example` file as an example to create a configuration file with certain environment variables:

```bash
$ cp .env.example .env.development
```

Next, the requirement that the application puts forward is to set up a database, for this there are two different options, `manually` or using `docker`.

### Set up the database manually

First of all, postgres needs to be installed, please see here <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/download/">please see here</a>.

Then run the following commands in the postgres console to create the database and issue permissions:

```bash
$ CREATE DATABASE "exchange-oracle";
$ CREATE USER operator WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'qwerty';
$ GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE "exchange-oracle" TO "operator";
$ \c "exchange-oracle" postgres
$ GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO operator;
```

Now we're ready to run the migrations:

```bash
yarn migration:run
```

### Set up the database with Docker

To run with docker, you need to enter the following command, which raises the container with postgres and runs the migrations:

```bash
yarn docker:db:up
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Running the app

```bash
# development
$ yarn run start

# watch mode
$ yarn run start:dev

# production mode
$ yarn run start:prod

# debug mode
$ yarn run start:debug
```

### Testing the app

```bash
# unit tests
$ yarn run test

# e2e tests
$ yarn run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ yarn run test:cov
```

### Migrations

```bash
# Create new migration
$ yarn migration:create addNameTable

# Generate new migration
$ yarn migration:generate addNameTable

# Revert latest migration
$ yarn migration:revert

# Run all pending migrations
$ yarn migration:run

# Show all migrations
$ yarn migration:show
```
