# Human Protocol Python SDK

Python SDK to interact with [Human Protocol](https://www.humanprotocol.org/)

## Installation

[Python3](https://www.python.org/) is required.

```bash
pip install human-protocol-sdk
```

## Getting Started

### Staking

Before creating an escrow, you need to stake HMT tokens to become a valid entity on Human Protocol.

`StakingClient` requires `Web3` instance to be initialized, and to be passed as a constructor argument. Set the `default_account` of `Web3` instance with the private key, so that it can be used for on-chain calls. Also, please don't forget to add `construct_sign_and_send_raw_middleware` middleware with name `construct_sign_and_send_raw_middleware`, because some providers do not support `eth_SendTransaction`.

```python
from eth_typing import URI
from web3 import Web3
from web3.providers.auto import load_provider_from_uri

w3 = Web3(load_provider_from_uri(URI("JSON_RPC_URL")))
gas_payer = w3.eth.account.from_key(priv_key)
w3.middleware_onion.add(
    construct_sign_and_send_raw_middleware(gas_payer),
    'construct_sign_and_send_raw_middleware'
)
w3.eth.default_account = gas_payer.address
```

Now, you can create a `StakingClient` instance, and stake HMT tokens on behalf of the gas payer you specified.

```python
from human_protocol_sdk import StakingClient

staking_client = StakingClient(w3)

# Stake 100 HMT
staking_client.approve_stake(100)
staking_client.stake(100)
```

After staking, and creating an escrow, you can allocate HMT tokens to the escrow.

```python
# Allocate 10 HMT
staking_client.allocate(escrow_address, 10)
```

After the job is finished/cancelled, you can close HMT allocation of the specific escrow.

```python
staking_client.close_allocation(escrow_address)
```

You can unstake/withdraw HMT tokens. However, there is some lock period for unstaked tokens to be ready for withdrawal.

```python
# Unstake 50 HMT
staking_client.unstake(50)

# Withdraw
staking_client.withdraw()
```

### Storage

Also, before creating an escrow you need to upload a manifest file.

`StorageClient` requires the URL of the S3-compatible service to be passed as a constructor argument. Also, you can pass a `Credentials` instance to authenticate with the S3-compatible service (default access is anonymous), the region of the service and a `boolean` flag to indicate the use secure (TLS) connection to S3 service or not

```python
from human_protocol_sdk import Credentials, StorageClient

storage_client = StorageClient(
    endpoint_url='https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com',
    region='us-west-2',
    credentials=Credentials(
        access_key='my-access-key',
        secret_key='my-secret-key'
    ),
    secure=True
)
```

Once this has been done, files can be uploaded and downloaded.

```python
bucket = 'my-bucket'

# Upload file
result_files = storage_client.download_files(files=[{'name': 'test_file'}], bucket=bucket)

# Download files
result_files = storage_client.download_files(files=['file1.txt'], bucket=bucket)
```

### Escrow

Creating a new HUMAN Protocol Escrow requires a `Web3` instance, an ERC20 token address to
use for pay outs, a list of addresses that can perform actions on the contract
and an `EscrowConfig` instance containing all the necessary information to setup an escrow.

Additionally, it requires a number of tokens to be previously staked.

First, a `Web3` instance must be created as shown in [Staking](#staking). An account must be
added to the instance to enable blockchain transaction signing.

```python
from eth_typing import URI
from web3 import Web3
from web3.providers.auto import load_provider_from_uri

w3 = Web3(load_provider_from_uri(URI("JSON_RPC_URL")))
gas_payer = w3.eth.account.from_key(priv_key)
w3.eth.default_account = gas_payer.address
```

Secondly, `EscrowConfig` must be created following this format:

```python
from human_protocol_sdk import EscrowConfig

escrow_config = EscrowConfig(
    recording_oracle_address = "0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8",
    reputation_oracle_address = "0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC",
    exchange_oracle_address = "0x6b7E3C31F34cF38d1DFC1D9A8A59482028395809",
    recording_oracle_fee = 10,
    reputation_oracle_fee = 10,
    exchange_oracle_fee = 10,
    manifest_url = "http://localhost:9000/manifests/manifest.json",
    hash = "s3ca3basd132bafcdas234243.json"
)
```

Calling `create_and_setup_escrow`, the escrow can be created and set up as follows:

```python
from human_protocol_sdk import EscrowClient

escrow_client = EscrowClient(w3)
escrow_address = escrow_client.create_and_setup_escrow(
    token_address = "0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3",
    trusted_handlers = ["0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"],
    escrow_config = escrow_config
)
```

The escrow must then be funded.

```python
escrow_client.fund(
    escrow_address = escrow_address,
    amount = Decimal('100.0')
)
```

While no payouts have been performed, aborting and canceling a job is still possible.

```python
escrow_client.abort(escrow_address = escrow_address)
escrow_client.cancel(escrow_address = escrow_address)
```

Performing a bulk payout that doesn't fully drain the escrow contract sets the contract to
Partial state. It also uploads the final results from the Reputation Oracle to the contract's
state.

```python
escrow_client.bulk_payout(escrow_address = escrow_address,
    recipients = ['0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC'],
    amounts = [Decimal('20.0')],
    final_results_url: 'http://localhost:9000/manifests/s3ca3basd132bafcdas234243.json',
    final_results_hash: 's3ca3basd132bafcdas234243.json',
    txId: Decimal(1))
status = escrow_client.status(escrow_address = escrow_address)
print(status)   # <Status.Partial: 2>
```

Draining the escrow contract fully sets the contract to Paid state.

```python
escrow_client.bulk_payout(escrow_address = escrow_address,
    recipients = ['0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC'],
    amounts = [Decimal('80.0')],
    final_results_url: 'http://localhost:9000/results/s3ca3basd132bafcdas234243.json',
    final_results_hash: 's3ca3basd132bafcdas234243.json',
    txId: Decimal(1))
status = escrow_client.status(escrow_address = escrow_address)
print(status)   # <Status.Paid: 3>
```

Completing the escrow sets a Paid contract to complete.

```python
escrow_client.complete(escrow_address = escrow_address)
status = escrow_client.status(escrow_address = escrow_address)Â 
print(status) # <Status.Complete: 4>
```

### KVStore

To interact with the KVStore contract, the KVStoreClient is used. It requires a `Web3` instance to be initialized,
and to be passed as a constructor argument as shown in [Staking](#staking).

```python
from eth_typing import URI
from web3 import Web3
from web3.providers.auto import load_provider_from_uri

w3 = Web3(load_provider_from_uri(URI("JSON_RPC_URL")))
gas_payer = w3.eth.account.from_key(priv_key)
w3.eth.default_account = gas_payer.address
```

Then, `KVStoreClient` instance can be created to store or retrieve values in the contract.

```python
from human_protocol_sdk import KVStoreClient

kvstore_client = KVStoreClient(w3)

# Set value
kvstore_client.set('key', 'value')


# Get value
result = kvstore_client.get('key')
print(result)# value
```

## Note for maintainers: Deploying to PyPi

A build will automatically be deployed to PyPi from master if tagged with a version number. This version number should match the version in the `setup.py` file.

The tags will need to be pushed to master via a user that has the proper privileges (see the contributors of this repo).

Versioning should follow the [semver](https://semver.org/) versioning methodology and not introduce breaking changes on minor or patch-level changes.
